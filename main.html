<h1>My holiday destination is Malaysia</h1>
	<br>
	<p>Malaysia is one of my favorite holiday destinations. The place is nice, the food is delicious, and the people are friendly. Known for its high buildings, such as KLCC, Malaysia has a lot to offer. Due to my hobby of photography, I have access to a good place to practice enhancing and boosting my skills. Apart from its famous KLCC, Malaysia is also known for its delicious food such as “Kacang Satay”.</p>
